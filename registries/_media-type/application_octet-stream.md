{% capture summary %}
Binary data (also including `image/*`, `video/*`, `audio/*` and other binary media types) is modeled using an empty Schema Object, in accordance with JSON Schema's guidance regarding [non-JSON instances](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-bhutton-json-schema-01.html#name-non-json-instances).  Note that as specified in the linked reference section ("Working with Binary Data"), modeling binary data that has been encoded into a string is handled differently from raw binary data, with two variations: One when an Encoding Object is involved, and one when no Encoding Object is involved.
