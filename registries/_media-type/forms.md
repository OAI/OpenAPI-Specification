{% capture summary %}
Web-style form data consists of name-value pairs, with duplicate names allowed, and are structured either in a way compatible with URI form query strings or as a `multipart` document.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture remarks %}
Both form media types use the [Encoding Object](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html#encoding-object) to map object properties from schema-ready data structures to name-value pairs, with special rules for arrays causing each array value to be treated as a separate pair with the same name.
While the ordering of pairs is significant in these formats, the OAS does not (as of v3.2) provide a way to control such ordering.

As of OAS v3.2, endpoint URL query strings can be modeled as a media type using `in: querystring` in the [Parameter Object](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html#parameter-object).  The query string can also be modeled using multiple `in: query` Parameter Objects through mechanisms similar to the Encoding Object.

Note that URL-encoded forms have been defined by different standards organizations at different times, leading to inconsistencies regarding percent-encoding in later standards and implementations; this is addressed in detail in [Appendix E](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html#appendix-e-percent-encoding-and-form-media-types).
