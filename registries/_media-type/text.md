{% capture summary %}
A plain text document is modeled as a single string.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture remarks %}
Note that unlike JSON strings, the contents of the string representing the plain text are not quoted when serializing to a document.  While a Schema Object of `{type: string, const: foo}` for JSON validates the JSON value `"foo"`, for plain text it validates `foo`, without quotes.
