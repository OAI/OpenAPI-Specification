  version: 1.0.0
# Since OAS 3.1.0 the paths element isn't necessary. Now a valid OpenAPI Document can describe only paths, webhooks, or even only reusable components
webhooks:
  # Each webhook needs a name
  newPet:
    # This is a Path Item Object, the only difference is that the request is initiated by the API provider
